# sampleproject

Vite + React + Material UI example containing Checkbox, Autocomplete, TextField.

Quick start (Windows `cmd.exe`):

```
cd sampleproject
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the printed localhost URL in your browser.

Notes:

- This project was scaffolded to match `create vite@latest sampleproject -- --template react`.
- Material UI packages are declared in `package.json`. If you want me to run `npm install` and start the dev server here, tell me and I can run those commands.
